# 700 Monitor(s) & Peripherals

## Monitor(s)

To look at the camera (hence at your audience) a smartphone (i.e. Apple iPhone) with the app of the video conferencing software (i.e. Microsoft Teams) is used. Once dialed in to the meeting via the app on the smartphone, the presenter looks at the smartphone's screen to see its audience. Placing the screen of the smartphone near the camera that records the presenter and the background (see Camera(s) & Peripherals), the audience perceives that the presenter is looking at them eye to eye. This is a much better way of eye-contact than if the presenter would be looking away from its audience.
