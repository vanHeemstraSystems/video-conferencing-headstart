## 200 Screen

### Use Neoprene Scuba Material for a black background backdrop.

Neoprene Scuba prevents glare when a projector projects light on it whilst at the same time the image is properly depicted, because of the lack of shine on this material. NOTE: Even though when seen by the human eye and no glare seen, instead a video camera will pick up on the glare. Neoprene Scuba will even not show a glare in video cameras. Another advangtage is the the rest of the room can be kept relatively lights as the light will not bounce off the Neoprene Scuba either. The texture absorbs all light.

Item: NEOPREEN SCUBA BLACK

Description:
- Material: 100% Polyester
- Width: 147 CM
- Weight: 370 gr/m2
- Thickness: 2MM

Price: € 16,95 per meter 

I recommend buying 3 meters so that the surface in total is 147 cm (height) by 300 cm (width) when used as a black backdrop.

*TIP*: Stitch velcro to the long size for easy fastening of the sheet to the rod along the top. Neoprene Scuba will not have creases of its own, but if you want to be sure about a flat surface, consider hanging weights from the bottom of the sheet.

### Use Stands to lift the backdrop.

### Use a Rod between the Stands to support the backdrop horizontally.
