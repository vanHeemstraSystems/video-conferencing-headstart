# 900 - Immersive Backgrounds

I have a poster behind me when I am in a web call of the cityscape of New York by night. I am partially blocking the poster as I am between my Mokose web cam and the poster. I want the viewer to see airplanes and lights to appear as if they are part of a real night scene of New York; planes passing by through the sky and building windows emitting light as if people live in them. My idea is to use footage of these airplanes and window lights over a green screen background which I feed into ATEM mini from my iPad. It becomes a source in OBS and I chroma key out the green screen. I then overlay the video over the web cam live stream as if the planes pass by and the windows light up. Is this a working approach or is there a better way? I understand that all video projected will be on top of my face in the web call, only around my upper body it will project on the poster. This is a flaw.

Let me help analyze this creative idea and suggest an improved approach to achieve your dynamic backdrop effect.



This improved approach addresses your concern about the animation appearing on top of you by using a mask. Here's why this solution is better:

1. **Masked Layering:**
   - Creates a mask around your silhouette
   - Animations only appear in the unmasked areas
   - Preserves natural depth perception

2. **Natural Integration:**
   - Animations can appear both in front and behind you
   - Maintains the illusion of depth in the scene
   - Allows for more dynamic movement paths

3. **Technical Benefits:**
   - Lower processing overhead
   - More precise control over effects
   - Better real-time performance

Tips for Implementation:
1. Light animations should match the poster's existing lighting 2. Keep movements subtle to maintain realism 3. Use gradual fade-ins/outs for window effects

Would you like me to:
1. Provide specific animation parameters for realistic plane movements?
2. Detail the mask creation process?
3. Explain how to handle different lighting conditions?

I'll help you create an immersive New York City night soundscape.

Implementation Tips:

1. **Sound Balance:**
   - Keep ambient sounds subtle enough for clear conversation
   - Use stereo panning for spatial depth
   - Layer sounds gradually

2. **Professional Considerations:**
   - Create a "Quick Mute" for all ambient audio
   - Have a "Meeting Mode" with minimal effects
   - Test all sounds with your normal speaking volume

3. **Technical Setup:**
   - Use high-quality audio samples (minimum 44.1kHz/16-bit)
   - Ensure proper audio sync with animations
   - Monitor CPU usage for smooth performance
