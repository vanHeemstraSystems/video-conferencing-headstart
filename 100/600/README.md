## 100 Key Light

The ***key light*** should be the brightest of the three and provides the bulk of light to your subject.

## 200 Fill Light

The ***fill light*** eliminates shadows caused by the key light. Your fill should be about half the intensity of your key so that it still eliminates shadows, but doesn’t produce a flat-looking shot due to the fill and key lights matching too closely.

## 300 Back Light

The ***back light*** separates your subject from the background. This creates depth and prevents a flat-looking shot. Your backlight can be hard light (no diffusion), as it won’t create shadows visible to the camera on the subject’s face.
